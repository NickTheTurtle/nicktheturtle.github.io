                        GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems show that a consistent system containing a specific amount of arithmetic is incomplete and is unable to prove its own consistency.

                            <li>A consistent system is defined as a system which axioms cannot lead to two contradictory statements.</li>
                            <li>A complete system is defined as a system which axioms can be used to prove or disprove any statement under the system's domain.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>
                        Due to the principle of explosion, an inconsistent system can prove any statement to be true. If math were to be a consistent system, it would be incomplete, and we cannot know that it is consistent without introducing other axioms. Either way would be disastrous for mathematics as an AoK.

                        How reliable is math? Most of our knowledge arguably is dependent on the validity of math. How reliable is our knowledge?

                        Math is extremely general and abstract. Using math to understand the physical world can unnecessarily complicate matters.

                        Is using math to find knowledge always practical and effective? Is understanding the actual world through the use of absract methods reliable?
